# Web2900 - Modern MV* Front End Frameworks (angular)

In this course, students learn the in-depth workings of a modern MV* front end framework (AngularJS or React) and the MV* design pattern in general. They will develop two applications of their own using a modern front-end framework.

Students will be presented with 10-15min formative assessments every single day in order to reinforce their recall of the angular concepts.

##Summary

#Lesson Plan
##Day 1
Angular basics, explaining what problem it solves and key terms: module/app, controller, scope, service, directive.
Do a formative assessment based on terminology and an exercise involving a really simple module with variables bound to the scope and using expressions to dynamically populate a page based on the value of expressions.
Start 50 examples demos and exercises. Example 1 - 10. Demo progression from plain HTML files, through plain js, jquery, backbone and angular. Purpose is to demonstrate what angular is doing behind the scenes for us. Students are asked to create basic examples based on the exercises.

##Day 9
Build an angular project from scratch. Students are asked to choose a project and create it from scratch using their knowledge of angular. The professor offers guidance and support, but it is the student that drives the project. If the student can't come up with an idea, the professor can suggest ideas to the student. As the student progresses in the class, the student is expected to add to the project. Project is due final day of class.



##Day 10
Creating a SPA from a set of HTML pages. The sweets complete application is used to create a SPA. The technique to do so is demonstrated taught to the students, and then the students are challenged to do the same on another set of HTML pages of the students choosing.
